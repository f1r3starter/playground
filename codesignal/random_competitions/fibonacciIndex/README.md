Consider the Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 ...

We can see that 7 is the smallest 0-based index k for which F(k) has exactly 2 decimal digits.
What is the smallest index k for which F(k) has exactly n decimal digits?

Example

For n = 1, the output should be
fibonacciIndex(n) = 0;
For n = 2, the output should be
fibonacciIndex(n) = 7.
