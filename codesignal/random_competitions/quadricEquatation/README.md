Solve quadratic equation of the form a * x2 + b * x + c = 0 and return sorted array of all its different real roots.

Example

For a = 1, b = -3, and c = 2, the output should be
quadraticEquation(a, b, c) = [1, 2];
For a = 1, b = 2, and c = 1, the output should be
quadraticEquation(a, b, c) = [-1];
For a = 2, b = 2, and c = 1, the output should be
quadraticEquation(a, b, c) = [].
