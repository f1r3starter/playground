For 2 given numbers A and B, find out their LCM and GCD.

Input:
The first line contains an integer 'T' denoting the total number of test cases. T testcases follow. In each test cases, there are two numbers A and B.

Output:
For each testcase, in a new line, find LCM and HCF.

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 30
1 <= a <= 1000
1 <= b <= 1000

Example:
Input:
2
5 10
14 8
Output:
10 5
56 2
